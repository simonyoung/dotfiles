Follow the instructions below on any Mac running Catalina or above 👍

## Initial Setup

Before I get started I install a few things manually to enable the rest of setup:

### iTerm2

Install `iTerm2` as a replacement for the default built-in Mac terminal.  Download it manually from the [website](https://www.iterm2.com).

### 1Password

I use `1Password` to store all of my passwords, logins and other secure items across devices  Download it manually from the [website](https://1password.com).

### Git & Xcode

Git operations on Mac OS requires Xcode Developer Tools which can be installed via the command line:

    xcode-select --install
